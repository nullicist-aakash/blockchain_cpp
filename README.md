# Blockchain in C++
This repo contains C++ code to read bloackchain transactions and display their results.

## Motivation
Internet is filled with various blockchain learning resources but very very few resources goes into byte level details. After learning blockchain from top level, I wanted to create my own blockchain in C++. The best way to do it is first look at existing code, as I am not yet confident of precise details stored in chain.
I am following the book: ![The Undocumented Internals of the Bitcoint, Ethereum and Blockchains](https://www.google.at/books/edition/THE_UNDOCUMENTED_INTERNALS_OF_THE_BITCOI/_YtjDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=bitcoin+in+c%2B%2B&printsec=frontcover)
